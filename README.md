# JavaExamples

## Java Thread
• The structure that enables to do more than one operation at the same time is called a thread.

• Thanks to this structure, transactions do their own transactions without waiting for each other.

## You can create threads in two ways in Java:

• extends Thread class

• implement Runnable interface

For the use of the Thread class, after the Thread class is inherited, the run method is override and the necessary commands are written.
